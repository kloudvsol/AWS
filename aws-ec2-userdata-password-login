echo 'ec2-user:password123' | sudo chpasswd
sudo sed -i 's/PasswordAuthentication no/PasswordAuthentication yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config

#This script will:

#Change the password for the ec2-user to the one you specify.

#Update the SSH configuration to allow password authentication.

#Restart the SSH service to apply the changes.

#Please note that enabling password login can decrease the security of your instance. It's recommended to use key-based authentication for better security. Always ensure that your password is strong and unique.
